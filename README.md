# COMP3015

This is my submission Readme for the COMP3015 CW2.
In this project I have attempted to use numerous techniques to create a more advanced shader than that of CW1, 
expanding on my code and working on more advanced techniques.
This project was made on the latest version of Windows 10, with up-to-date drivers.
It was developed in Viusal Studio 2019, version 16.7.5.

The submission will reflect that I struggled to get numerous expanded techniques working with one another, 
despite support and help from others. OpenGL has been a serious learning curve for myself, however, given more time,
I believe I could become very adapt with it.

The Video is shorter than intended due to being unable to do an adequate voice over.
